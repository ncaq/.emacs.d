# My Emacs config

It is my Emacs config.

# LICENSE

The code I wrote is GPL-3.0-or-later, just like the license of Emacs.
Code copied from elsewhere is subject to the original license.
I do not claim copyright on anything that would be the same no matter who wrote it.
I don't insist on copyrighting every little copy.
